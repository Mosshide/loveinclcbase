    <h2>Uniting the Church to Help People in Need</h2>
    <p>
        The local church is God’s answer to community brokenness and a part of his plan of redemption and restoration. 
        That’s why we mobilize local churches to offer a holistic approach to caring for people in all areas of life: 
        spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical.

        Love INC is Christ-Centered
    </h3>
    <p>
        All that we do and say must honor and glorify our Lord Jesus Christ. 
        We believe that churches are called to live and labor in the love of the Creator by doing, sharing 
        and growing in His goodness as they endeavor to reveal and share the love of Christ to others in all
        aspects of their lives.  (cf. Romans 12:2)

    <h3>An Instrument of Transformation</h3>
    <p>
        The Scriptures urge us to not be conformed to the patterns of this world, but instead to be vessels of God’s
        purpose on earth.  Through the gifts given us, our actions, words and deeds become opportunities for ministry
        and leadership as God’s instruments through instruction, correction and guidance.  (cf. 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 
        Romans 12:1-2; 2 Corinthians 3:18)

    <h3>Part of a Global Community</h3>
        <p>
            We seek out and grow relationships with local churches and the larger community around the world.  
            (cf. Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8)

            One of our "Love Stories"...
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Due to an abusive situation, a mother of three had to leave the residence and is currently living in her car.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            She was faced with the reality that this was no way to raise children so she reluctantly, but voluntarily, gave 
            them over to foster care. This was very emotional for her to talk about, but she was open and receptive to prayer. 
            Love INC was able to help her with a laundry voucher and signed her up with a parenting class that is faith based.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            While she is waiting for housing, she has started seeking employment.  She is trying to find suitable housing for 
            her and the children. She misses them. Please be in prayer for this situation and that she can find housing soon 
            so she can be reunited with her children.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Please keep praying for our neighbors in need.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>God Bless You!</p>
