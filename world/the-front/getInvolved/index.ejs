            Dear Pastors, Church Members and Community Members:
        </h5>
        <p>
            Love in the Name of Christ of Lewis County has had minimal furniture volunteers 
            since Covid. Now we are down to one furniture volunteer - who is having a health issue and will 
            not be able to return until the beginning of August.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to these facts, the furniture ministry portion of Love INC will be placed on hold until 
            we have additional volunteers for the furniture truck and for furniture intake and requests.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please be in prayer with us about the continuation or discontinuation of the Love INC Furniture Ministry.
        </p>

    <h3>Pray It Forward</h3>
    
    <p>
        Pray It Forward provides a way to give a financial blessing to someone in need, with a gas/propane, food, 
        laundry voucher, or assistance in paying a portion of their utility bill or rent. Unique requests like 
        wheelchair ramps, prescription eye glasses or other concerns are also considered and require prayer for 
        direction and guidance. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As you submit your financial gift through our website, pray for the person-in-need who receives your assistance...
        that they will be blessed and touched by your generosity.  And in doing so, God will bless you both in a very special way.

        firewood, home repairs, food and gas as well as referrals to other organizations?
    </p>
    <p>
        You can be a part of that--Love In the Name of Christ's Mission is to "Mobilize Local Churches to Transform Lives and 
        Communities in the Name of Christ."

        We are seeking volunteers to provide services, compassion, continued prayer and financial partnership. We listen, 
        we pray, we love and we serve.
    </p>
    <p>What gift has God given you to share with others?</p>
    <p>If you are interested in being part of this exciting opportunity, call us at (360) 748-8611.</p>
