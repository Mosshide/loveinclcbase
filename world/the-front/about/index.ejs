        <p>
            When a request for help comes to Love INC, the need is assessed to determine it's nature and legitimacy.  
            The need is either handled at the Love INC offices or matched with a resource from a local church or professional.  
            Love INC's emphasis is on person-to-person assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that requests can take up to two weeks from start (intake call-request) to completion. All calls are 
            taken in order of when the call was received. Duplicate calls hinder the response time. Thank you for your patience.
            Our phone number is (360) 748-8611.
